This is the simulation for Maneater.

Inputs are all given in main with each input defined alone.

To run just change the simulation settings (num threads and num elements) in main.
<br>

``// SIMULATION SETTINGS``
<br>
```long long int num_elements = 10'000'000;  // NUMBER OF ITERATIONS TO BE RUN```
<br>
``const int num_threads = 20;         // NUMBER OF CORES TO USE``
